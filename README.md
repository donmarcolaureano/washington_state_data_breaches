# Washington State Data Breaches


Washington law requires entities impacted by a data breach to notify the Attorney General’s Office (AGO) when more than 500 Washingtonians personal information was compromised as a result of the breach. This dataset is a collection of various statistics that have been derived from these notices, and is the source of data used to produce the AGO’s Annual Data Breach Report.
